    <!-- Notes and explanations for interview and new learners:
This example demonstrates how to use the .bind() method to ensure the correct 'this' context in event handlers, especially in classes.


<script>
    // Define a class named React
    class React{
        constructor(){
            this.library = "React"; // Property of the class
            this.server = "https://localhost:3000"; // Another property

            // Add a click event listener to the button
            // Use .bind(this) to ensure 'this' inside handleClick refers to the class instance
            document
            .querySelector('button')
            .addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this))
        }
        handleClick(){
            // This method will be called when the button is clicked
            // 'this' refers to the class instance because of .bind(this)
            console.log("button clicked")
            console.log(this.server) // Accesses the server property of the class
        }
    }

    // Create an instance of the React class
    const app = new React()
</script>


Key Explanations:
- In JavaScript classes, 'this' inside event handlers can lose its context (not refer to the class instance).
- .bind(this) ensures that 'this' inside handleClick always refers to the class instance, not the button or global object.
- This is a common pattern in React and other frameworks to avoid bugs with 'this' in callbacks.
- Always use .bind(this) (or arrow functions) when passing class methods as event handlers.
- This example is useful for understanding event handling, class context, and the use of .bind().
