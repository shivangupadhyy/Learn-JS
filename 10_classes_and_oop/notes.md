# JavaScript and Classes

## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
<!-- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (properties) and code (methods). -->

## object
- collection of properties (data) and methods (functions)
- Example: String methods like `toLowerCase()`

## why use OOP
<!-- OOP helps organize code, makes it reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain by modeling real-world entities as objects. -->

## parts of OOP
object literal <!-- Simple way to create a single object -->
- constructor function <!-- Function used to create multiple objects with the same structure -->
- Prototypes <!-- Mechanism to share methods and properties across instances -->
- classes <!-- ES6 syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance -->
- instances (new, this) <!-- Objects created from classes or constructor functions -->

## 4 pillar
define:-
abstraction <!-- Hiding complex details and showing only essentials -->
encapsulation <!-- Wrapping data and methods together, restricting direct access -->
inheritance <!-- Mechanism to create new classes from existing ones -->
polymorphism <!-- Ability to use a single interface for different data types or classes -->

<!--
Summary:
- OOP in JavaScript can be implemented using object literals, constructor functions, prototypes, and ES6 classes.
- The four pillars (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) help write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Understanding these concepts is important for interviews and real-world JavaScript development.
